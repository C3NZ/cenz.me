If you're a sports fan, then you most likely have heard the term, "The G.O.A.T." thrown around to describe athletes with exceptional talent & skill. But what exactly does "The G.O.A.T" mean and why is it relevant to this article?

When we refer to someone as the G.O.A.T., we aren't talking about the animal, rather the *greatest of all time*. The reason I bring up this term up is because we might be lucky and privileged enough to get to witness one in the notorious videogame, *Fortnite*.

In late 2017, Fortnite made waves in the videogame community & industry, producing numbers and a community that some triple A titles could *only dream of reaching*. With such a vast number of players, it was only time till the exceptional players stood out amongst the heaps of average-to-lower tier players. Gucci_grem being one of those exceptional players.

Gucci_grem has been playing Fortnite for quite some time now, but only started to make moves on social media recently. Within the first week of his Fortnite highlights and short clips being published, he has received an insane amount of appraisal and admiration from the community for his skill.

Without revealing the identities of those who have seen and talked about his clips, here are some quotes:

`"Wow, this is insane dude. I couldn't dream about hitting a shot like that"`<br>

![Pistol shot]({{site.url}}/assets/images/nite2.png)
`"How were you able to do that with that just a pistol? Jesus"`<br>

![Crossbow shot]({{site.url}}/assets/images/nite3.png)
`"I didn't think anyone in the community was going to eclipse Ninjas skill level in this game, but after some of these clips, I would be terrified if I were him."`<br>

And the list of compliments goes on.

While this may a case of the infamous "Lebron vs Jordan" argument, there is one thing that is very clear: ***Gucci_Grem is really really good and will only be getting better***.

As time goes on, I'm excited to see what else Gucci_grem is going to do on Fortnite and for all the content that he is going to be putting out. If you'd like to subscribe to him yourself, he can be found under the handle "Gucci_grem" on all social media platforms.

Thank you for reading.
